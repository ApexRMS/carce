## Evaluating the effects of multiple stressors on caribou
### *Carce* is an open-source [SyncroSim](https://syncrosim.com/) Base Package for simulating the cumulative effects of development and climate change on caribou.

The **Carce** package contains a built-in stochastic multi-model framework for forecasting the cumulative effects of stressors on barren-ground caribou herds. This framework is referred to as the **Caribou Cumulative Effects (CCE)** modeling framework. Built upon the [SyncroSim](https://syncrosim.com/) software platform, the **CCE** framework has been developed to better inform caribou management decisions in the face of future uncertainties. The **CCE** model accounts for stressors to ungulates including land disturbance, environmental conditions, harvest and natural mortality. These stressors are integrated into several interconnected submodels; a Vegetation/Land Use Change submodel, which forecasts changes in vegetation and land use across a herd’s range over space and time; a Caribou Movement submodel, which projects daily movement of individual caribou across the study area based on historical data; a Body Condition submodel, which projects the body condition of an individual caribou cow (and its newborn calf) as it moves across the range over the course of a single year; and finally, a Population submodel, adapted from the [DG-Sim](https://apexrms.github.io/dgsim/) stochastic population model, which operates on an annual time step, projecting the total size of the herd’s population (by sex and age) each year as a function of the current population size, birth rates, natural mortality rates, and harvest levels.
